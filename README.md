● English: System for Retinal Vascular Health Screening 

● Vietnamese: Hệ Thống Sàng Lọc Sức Khỏe Mạch Máu Võng Mạc

● Abbreviation: SP26SE025

a. Context:
1. In the era of preventative medicine and personalized healthcare, the early detection of systemic health risks has become an essential requirement for enhancing quality of life and reducing the burden of healthcare costs. However, many serious diseases, particularly those related to cardiovascular, diabetic, and neurological conditions, often progress silently and are only discovered in their late stages.
2. Many individuals in Vietnam face barriers in accessing comprehensive, non-invasive, and regular screening methods due to high costs, complex procedures, or a lack of specialized personnel at the grassroots level. The absence of a fast, accurate, and widely deployable screening tool presents a significant challenge.

b. Proposed Solutions

-The Comprehensive AI Understanding Retinal Analysis (AURA) offers an integrated approach to enhance early detection and prevention of diseases through retinal imaging analysis.

+Clinical Decision Support, Not Replacement: AURA acts as a Clinical Decision Support (CDS) tool that assists — not replaces — physicians. The AI system analyzes retinal vasculature to detect subtle vascular abnormalities and provide early diseases risk assessments, enabling doctors to make faster and more confident decisions.

+Expanding Access to Preventive Care: By connecting to existing fundus cameras and offering cloud-based analysis, AURA makes advanced vascular screening available even to community clinics and mid-tier hospitals. This reduces the need for costly diagnostic infrastructure and helps bring preventive healthcare to underserved regions.

+Retinal Imaging as a Non-Invasive Health Indicator: The system leverages the eye as a “window” to systemic health, using retinal vessel morphology to estimate risks of hypertension, diabetes complications, and stroke — transforming routine eye exams into a broader tool for disease risk screening.

+Data Collaboration and Continuous Learning: AURA encourages data partnerships between clinics, hospitals, and research institutions. It begins with open datasets for model training and evolves through real-world feedback, strengthening both the AI model and the clinical understanding of vascular health.

+Ethical, Transparent, and Secure AI Use: All outputs are interpretable and visually explainable, allowing doctors to validate AI findings. Strict data privacy, patient anonymization, and compliance with medical regulations ensure safe and responsible AI adoption.

-In essence, AURA delivers a scalable, ethical, and data-driven solution that empowers healthcare providers to detect cardiovascular risks early, reduce diagnostic barriers, and improve patient outcomes through AI-assisted retinal screening.
